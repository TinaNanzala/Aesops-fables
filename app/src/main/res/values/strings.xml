    <string name="Fable_1_text"> A man named Androcles once escaped from his master and fled to the forest. As he was wandering about there he came upon a Lion lying down moaning and groaning. At first he turned to flee, but finding that the Lion did not pursue him, he turned back and went up to him.

As he came near, the Lion put out his paw, which was all swollen and bleeding, and Androcles found that a huge thorn had got into it, and was causing all the pain. He pulled out the thorn and bound up the paw of the Lion, who was soon able to rise and lick the hand of Androcles like a dog. Then the Lion took Androcles to his cave, and every day used to bring him meat from which to live./n

But shortly afterwards both Androcles and the Lion were captured, and the slave was sentenced to be thrown to the Lion, after the latter had been kept without food for several days. The Emperor and all his Court came to see the spectacle, and Androcles was led out into the middle of the arena. /n Soon the Lion was let loose from his den, and rushed bounding and roaring towards his victim.

But as soon as he came near to Androcles he recognised his friend, and fawned upon him, and licked his hands like a friendly dog. The Emperor, surprised at this, summoned Androcles to him, who told him the whole story. Whereupon the slave was pardoned and freed, and the Lion let loose to his native forest."

    <string name="Fable_2_text">The Lion and the Fox went hunting together.

The Lion, on the advice of the Fox, sent a message to the Ass, proposing to make an alliance between their two families.

The Ass came to the place of meeting, overjoyed at the prospect of a royal alliance.

But when he came there the Lion simply pounced on the Ass, and said to the Fox:

Here is our dinner for to-day. Watch you here while I go and have a nap. Woe betide you if you touch my prey.

The Lion went away and the Fox waited; but finding that his master did not return, ventured to take out the brains of the Ass and ate them up.

When the Lion came back he soon noticed the absence of the brains, and asked the Fox in a terrible voice:

What have you done with the brains?

    <string name="Fable_3_text">"An Ass congratulated a Horse on being so ungrudgingly and carefully provided for, while he himself had scarcely enough to eat, nor even that without hard work.

    But when war broke out, the heavy armed soldier mounted the Horse, and rushed into the very midst of the enemy, and the Horse, being wounded, fell dead on the battle-field.

    Then the Ass, seeing all these things, changed his mind, and commiserated the Horse, saying: How much more fortunate am I than a charger. I can remain at home in safety while he is exposed to all the perils of war."

He ordered his servants to bring in a faggot of sticks, and said to his eldest son:

Break it.

The son strained and strained, but with all his efforts was unable to break the Bundle.

The other sons also tried, but none of them was successful.

Untie the faggots,said the father,and each of you take a stick."

The gods were once disputing whether it was possible for a living being to change its nature.

Jupiter said Yes, but Venus said "No." So, to try the question, Jupiter turned a Cat into a Maiden, and gave her to a young man for a wife.

    The wedding was duly performed and the young couple sat down to the wedding-feast.

    See,said Jupiter, to Venus, how becomingly she behaves. Who could tell that yesterday she was but a Cat? Surely her nature is changed?"

If thy owner had found thee, and not I, he would have taken thee up, and have set thee in thy first estate; but I have found thee for no purpose.

    I would rather have one barleycorn than all the jewels in the world."

    The Dog was delighted with the invitation, and as he stood by and saw the preparations for the feast, said to himself: "Capital fare indeed! this is, in truth, good luck. I shall revel in dainties, and I will take good care to lay in an ample stock to-night, for I may have nothing to eat to-morrow.

    As he said this to himself, he wagged his tail, and gave a sly look at his friend who had incited him.

    But his tail wagging to and fro caught the cook's eye, who, seeing a stranger, straightway seized him by the legs, and threw him out the window to the street below.

    When he reached the ground, he set off yelping down the street; upon which the neighbors' dogs ran up to him and asked him how he liked his supper. "In faith," said he, with a sorry smile, "I hardly know, for we drank so deeply, that I can't even tell you which way I got out."

    <string name="Fable_10_text">A quarrel had arisen between the Horse and the Stag, so the Horse came to a Hunter to ask his help to take revenge on the Stag.

The Hunter agreed, but said: "If you desire to conquer the Stag, you must permit me to place this piece of iron between your jaws, so that I may guide you with these reins, and allow this saddle to be placed upon your back so that I may keep steady upon you as we follow after the enemy."

The Horse agreed to the conditions, and the Hunter soon saddled and bridled him.\n

Then with the aid of the Hunter the Horse soon overcame the Stag, and said to the Hunter: "Now, get off, and remove those things from my mouth and back."

"Not so fast, friend," said the Hunter. "I have now got you under bit and spur, and prefer to keep you as you are at present."
